## Basic Concepts

- Linux is an open-source operating system used heavily in servers and security environments.
- The shell (often Bash) lets you interact with the OS via commands.

## Key Commands

- `pwd`: Show current directory
- `ls`: List files
- `cd`: Change directory
- `cp`, `mv`, `rm`: Copy, move, delete files
- `mkdir`, `touch`: Create folders and files
- `man`: Show manual for a command

## File Structure

- `/home`: User files
- `/etc`: Config files
- `/var`: Logs and variable data
- `/bin` and `/usr/bin`: Executable programs

## Navigation Tips

Use `Tab` to auto-complete commands and paths.

## Permissions

- `r` (read), `w` (write), `x` (execute)
- Use `chmod`, `chown` to change permissions/ownership
