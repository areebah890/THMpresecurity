2. DNS resolves the domain name to an IP
3. Your browser sends an HTTP request
4. The server responds with HTML/CSS/JS
5. Browser renders the page

## Key Protocols

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Used to request and receive web content
- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses
- **TCP/IP**: Underlying transport/network protocols

## HTTP Status Codes
