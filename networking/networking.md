## üß© Part 1: Networking Basics

### Key Concepts
- **IP Address**: Unique identifier for a device on a network  
- **Subnet Mask**: Divides IP into network and host parts  
- **Default Gateway**: Device that routes traffic outside the local network  
- **MAC Address**: Hardware address of network interface

### Basic Commands
```bash
ipconfig          # Windows - Display IP config
ifconfig          # Linux/macOS - Display IP config
ping <address>    # Test connectivity to an IP or domain
tracert <address> # Windows traceroute
traceroute <address> # Linux/macOS traceroute
```

## üîå Part 2: Protocols and Ports

### Common Protocols
| Protocol | Port | Description                |
|----------|------|----------------------------|
| HTTP     | 80   | Web traffic                |
| HTTPS    | 443  | Secure web traffic         |
| FTP      | 20/21| File transfer              |
| SSH      | 22   | Secure shell               |
| DNS      | 53   | Domain name resolution     |
| SMTP     | 25   | Sending emails             |
| POP3     | 110  | Receiving emails           |
| IMAP     | 143  | Receiving emails (advanced)|

### Port Scanning
```bash
nmap -p 1-65535 <target>   # Scan all ports
nmap -sV <target>          # Detect service versions
```

## üîß Part 3: Network Troubleshooting & Security

### Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
netstat -an          # List active connections and listening ports
nslookup <domain>    # Query DNS servers
arp -a               # Display MAC-IP mappings
route print          # View routing table
```

### Network Security Concepts
- **Firewalls**: Control incoming/outgoing network traffic  
- **VPNs**: Secure encrypted tunnels over the internet  
- **IDS/IPS**: Intrusion detection/prevention systems monitor malicious traffic
